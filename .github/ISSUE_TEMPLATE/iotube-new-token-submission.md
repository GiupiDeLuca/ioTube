# ioTube Token submission

<!--
## Introduction

ioTube is a two-way, multi-asset, cross-chain protocol bridging IoTeX 
to other blockchains such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and others. 
Anyone can submit their token to be added to ioTube: if you deployed a token 
on IoTeX, you can make your dApp cross-chain and reach the audience of other 
popular chains. Likewise, if you have deployed your token on Ethereum or any 
blockchain other than IoTeX, thanks to ioTube you can extend your dApp to the 
IoTeX ecosystem, taking advantage of the 5-second tx confirmations, ultra-low fees,
and access other unique IoTeX features like real-world IoT data oracles, etc..

## Guidelines for tokens
We will only take into consideration projects that 

- does not represent any type of cryptocurrency "scam" e.g. project counterfeit and others.
- shows clear signs of activity: either traffic on the network, activity on GitHub, or community buzz.

In addition:
- Only tokens from Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain or Polygon can be bridged to IoTeX at the moment.
- Bridging IoTeX tokens to other blockchains will be available in the future.
- The token icon should be small, square, but high resolution, ideally a vector/svg.
- Make sure your website includes a detailed explanation of project and the token contract address.
- No Profanity in token name, token description, etc.

## How would you like your token to be bridged?
<!--
There are two options below. 
Option 1 is preferred if your token is supported by other bridges yet. Examples are MCN, CIOTX, iMAGIC
Option 2 is for tokens that are only need a single bridge between one blockchain and IoTeX. Examples are USDT, USDC, BUSD, etc.
-->

* [ ] Bridge Option 1. Create a crosschain token and bridge it to all different blockchains 
* [ ] Bridge Option 2. Just bridge my token to IoTeX (from source chain to IoTeX)

## What is the preferred name of your bridged token

* [ ] the same as my token on source blockchain (Bridge option 1)
* [ ] C-token (denoting the crosschain version of the token) (Bridge Option 1)
* [ ] add a subfix denoting the source blockchain (```_b``` for bsc, ```_m``` for matic) (Bridge Option 2)
* [ ] other, please specify:
