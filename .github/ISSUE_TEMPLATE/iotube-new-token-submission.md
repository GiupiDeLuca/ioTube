# ioTube Token submission

<!--
## Introduction

ioTube is a two-way, multi-asset, cross-chain protocol bridging IoTeX 
to other blockchains such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, and others. 
Anyone can submit their token to be added to ioTube: if you deployed a token 
on IoTeX, you can make your dApp cross-chain and reach the audience of other 
popular chains. Likewise, if you have deployed your token on Ethereum or any 
blockchain other than IoTeX, thanks to ioTube you can extend your dApp to the 
IoTeX ecosystem, taking advantage of the 5-second tx confirmations, ultra-low fees,
and access other unique IoTeX features like real-world IoT data oracles, etc..

## Guidelines for tokens
We will only take into consideration projects that 

- does not represent any type of cryptocurrency "scam" e.g. project counterfeit and others.
- shows clear signs of activity: either traffic on the network, activity on GitHub, or community buzz.

In addition:
- Only tokens from Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain or Polygon can be bridged to IoTeX at the moment.
- Bridging IoTeX tokens to other blockchains will be available in the future.
- The token icon should be small, square, but high resolution, ideally a vector/svg.
- Make sure your website includes a detailed explanation of project and the token contract address.
- No Profanity in token name, token description, etc.

Please fill the data below for us to review your submission and reach out to you 
for more information.

## Select the tokens you want to bridge to IoTeX
<!-- 
    Please select the tokens you want to bridge to IoTeX, along with their contract address.
    For each one, we will add it to the respective ioTube section, and a proxy XRC20 token 
    called XXX-sss will be created on IoTeX, where "XXX" is the symbol of your token on the 
    source chain, and "sss" is a symbol representing the source chain. These tokens will be 
    the "corresponding" tokens minted on IoTeX each time a user sends them to ioTube from 
    the source chaina: there is no need for you to create any "correspnding" token on IoTeX.

## If your token is native to IoTeX
 
Please notice that at this moment we only accept ioTube submissions for tokens native to Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain or Polygon to be bridged to IoTeX.
Bridging IoTeX tokens to other blockchains will be available in the future.
